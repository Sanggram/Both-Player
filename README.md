# BOTH SECURITY ECOSYSTEM
**Version:** 2.0+ (Titan Flow & Deep Forensics Core)
**Developer:** Sanggram Biswas (Both Security)

## 📌 Overview
The "Both Security" ecosystem is a unified, privacy-first software suite designed to replace vulnerable, data-tracking default operating system applications. Built for maximum local security, this ecosystem provides an isolated and impenetrable environment for executing, analyzing, and viewing digital assets without compromising user data or exposing the system to malicious scripts.

## 🛡️ Why Use Both Security?
Standard software often tracks user behavior and hides underlying file data. Both Security handles every piece of media, code, or image with forensic precision. By controlling the exact execution environment, the suite neutralizes potential tracking scripts, prevents accidental malware triggers, and provides deep data visibility (metadata, hashes, and raw code) that typical applications obscure.

## ⚙️ Core Modules & Features

### 1. Both Secure Player (Titan Flow V2.1)
The central mastermind and media hub for the entire ecosystem.
* **Zero-Delay Engine:** Utilizes a highly optimized VLC backend loaded via a background thread for instant startup and buffer-free playback.
* **Centralized Dashboard:** Instantly launch the Code Editor, Photo Scanner, and Downloader directly from the main player interface.
* **On-Screen Display (OSD):** Real-time overlay showing file size, resolution, frame rate, and other critical media data.
* **System Override:** Permanently registers Both Player as the default handler for all media, code, and image files via Windows Registry, securing the entire OS environment.
* **OTA Updates:** Automated background checks for seamless Over-The-Air updates.

### 2. Both Downloader (Professional UI)
A highly resilient and secure media extraction tool.
* **High-Fidelity Extraction:** Leverages FFmpeg to seamlessly merge ultra-high-definition video (8K/4K/HD) with audio, or extract pure MP3 streams.
* **Automation & Batching:** Supports batch downloading via TXT files and precise clip extraction using custom start/end timestamps.
* **Smart Engine Fallback:** Automatically detects failed extractions (e.g., complex Facebook links) and seamlessly reroutes requests to bypass restrictions and ensure successful downloads.

### 3. Both Code Viewer (Engine V2)
A specialized, isolated text and source code analyzer for secure script review.
* **Universal Syntax Highlighting:** Custom regex-based color-coding for C, Python, Web, and Database languages within a secure, cyber-themed environment.
* **Super Formatter:** Automatically sanitizes, cleans, and indents raw or obfuscated code arrays for immediate readability.
* **Radar Search:** Advanced query function to quickly highlight specific target strings, functions, or hidden variables across large codebases.

### 4. Both Photo Viewer (Deep Forensics Edition)
An advanced visual analysis tool built for digital forensics and threat detection.
* **Deep EXIF Extraction:** Scans and extracts hidden metadata attached to image files, revealing device data, locations, and origins.
* **Cryptographic Verification:** Calculates and displays SHA-256 and MD5 hashes instantly to verify file integrity and detect unauthorized tampering.
* **Advanced Optics Mode:** Applies specialized vision filters (Matrix, Edge Detection, X-Ray) to expose hidden patterns, anomalies, or steganography within the image matrix.

## 🚀 How to Use (Best Practices)
For maximum security and isolated malware analysis:
1. **Extract:** Use the **Both Downloader** to pull suspected files or media securely from the web.
2. **Verify:** Open images in the **Photo Viewer** to calculate their cryptographic hash and check against global threat databases.
3. **Analyze:** Review unknown scripts or raw files via the **Code Viewer** to spot malicious payloads before execution.
4. **Lock Down:** Run the **Titan Player** with administrative privileges and click `[ SET AS DEFAULT PLAYER ]` to bind your OS to the Both Security ecosystem, preventing external, vulnerable apps from launching files.
